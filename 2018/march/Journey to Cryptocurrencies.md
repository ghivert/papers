<small>The Journey Is Only Beginning</small>

My first encounter with blockchain happened 5 years ago. Back in 2013: I was 19 years old, and the bitcoin just increased over 300 dollars. This was already incredible. And already almost impossible to mine with a GPU. All forums were talking about ASIC, and the atmosphere was absolutely crazy. A completely decentralized technology, built by a perfect unknown. Everybody talked about it, but no one really got it by the time. Bitcoin was complicated, and not accessible to the public. 'But people get rich with it!' That's mainly what we saw. I remember tried to mine some Dogecoin with my modest GPU, and gave up soon after. That was still far west. Some tried to do things, others traded, others didn't understand why such a money could rise so high.

And here we are now. Blockchains emerged. ICO were popularized in 2017. Ethereum decentralized servers. CryptoKitties makes you _catcurer_. Banks want to jump in too. States are afraid of things they can't control. Crypto-currencies is no more a weird concept. Crypto-enthusiast are now fully recognized. Ethereum and blockchains developers are the new gold mine. Blockchains are everywhere, on everyone's lips among software engineers.

My second encounter with blockchain happened some months ago. Just when bitcoin raised again, from 300 dollars to 5000 dollars. I wouldn't pass my chance once again, and bought some bitcoins, some ethereum, and some litecoin. It was back in last December. I couldn't stop myself checking trades and exchanges. I wanted to get the most out of it. Actually, I wanted making money. I wanted to become rich. You know, this pretty idea saying that you'll buy some coins, and sell them later for 10 000 times more. Yes, that was definitely what I was looking for, even if I didn't get by that time.
I was not a software engineer by then. I became trader.

<small>That was exactly what my smartphone looked like for two months</small>

But my life became desperately dreary. I spent so much of my time checking exchanges… Then, holidays came, and it was a blessing. I stopped checking exchanges, I stopped trading cryptos, and guess what? Nothing changed in my life. I neither lost nor gained money. It was **perfectly the same than before**.

That was eye-opening. I completely stopped trading cryptos. I came back to what I really love. Computer Science. Software Engineering. Spending time with family without thinking to anything else. Focus on what matters. But this time was different. I didn't give up with blockchains. In fact, I'm working with blockchains a lot more. I learned a lot of things through this experiment, and cryptos (more specifically Ethereum) is absolutely awesome. I really love this technology, and want to work with in the future. Because blockchains is one the future. I'm sure about this.

But I'm not a fuel trader. Because that's what cryptos are in the end. **They're fuel.** They only exists to power blockchains. And finally, that's why you'll use then. Powering blockchains.

If you buy a car, you can expect to refuel it when you need it, through gas station. Then, you'll use all the fuel until you get out of it, and refuel your car. And guess what? That's how you should think with cryptos. Are you trading fuel? No? Well, because you could. There's maybe not so much variance when you compare it to cryptos, but that's exactly the same mechanics. When you want to use a dApp – CryptoKitties for example – you need to use Ether to fuel the world computer. You can refuel your wallet (Coinbase, the web 3.0 gas station), and use your coins to buy the perfect, cute genesis kitty with them. And the receiver will for sure trade them for dollars. Because in the end, **you're paying your taxes, your food, and everything you need with your local currency**.

<small>Coinbase, is that you?</small>

Of course, my advice would be to stop trading cryptos. Cryptos are cool. But why trading cryptos specifically? Are you trading companies shares? You can do trading with whatever you want. Why not trading alcohol (Japanese whisky prices can go really, really high)? Why not trading sneakers? If you're trading cryptos because it's easy, you're missing a whole part of them. Of course they're assets (and so represent money) but you can do much more with them. Buy them, trade them if you want, use them to freely send money to anybody, use them to access dApp like DelegateCall.

My journey with cryptos and blockchains is a real pleasure, and I never regret it. Blockchain technology is awesome. But I'm not a trader. I'm a *software engineer*. Sometimes, when I want to make a strong impression, I'm saying that I'm a *software architect*. "Woaw! So you're building house?" Well… Not really. Anyway, I'm sure I'll never introduce myself saying I'm a trader. So the next times someone tell you that he's working on blockchain, please, please, don't respond something like "One of my friend is trading Ether too! I think he's waiting for rates to increase…" or "Oh, I'm mining too!". **Because that's not what we're doing.**

We're building the next century software. We're building decentralized stuff. We're fighting against the centralization and the censorship threat. We're coding smart contracts and better algorithms. We want to regain our sovereignty that we're losing with all services perpetually wanting to use our personal data to make profit. We want to improve the world with breaking-change technology. Because technology is key today, and it should not be only accessible to the privileged people. So mine some ether, create a node, write smart contract, and take back the control of your data.
